# Abstraction-In-Java
Welcome to the Java Abstraction Examples repository! This collection is designed to provide comprehensive examples and explanations for understanding and implementing abstraction in Java.  Whether you're just starting with Java or looking to deepen your knowledge, these examples cover essential concepts and best practices related to abstraction.

## Introduction
Abstraction is a crucial concept in object-oriented programming that involves simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on their essential features. 
It allows developers to focus on the relevant details while hiding unnecessary complexities, promoting modularity, and improving code maintainability.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Abstract Classes
- **Description**: Classes that cannot be instantiated on their own and may contain abstract methods.Methods without a body, to be implemented by subclasses.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  abstract class Shape {
      // Abstract method
      public abstract void draw();

      // Concrete method
      public void displayArea() {
          System.out.println("Calculating area...");
      }
  }
